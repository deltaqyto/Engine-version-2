Started new project. Discontinued old model due to incoherent design standards

11/10/2020
Finished basic maths libraries for 2d and 3d surfaces. Will be expanded to process matrices

12/10/2020
Render pipeline:
Tris in obj coords
convert to world coord
convert to cam coord
clip near and far
-- clip sides?
project to 2d
clip sides?
draw tris to screen

22/10/2020
Clip algorithm in progress
Render pipline formed
Tris overclipped

23/10/2020
Fixed overclipping
Loaded sliced cube model for depth buffer testing
Created depth buffer set and reset functions - to be timed
calculated barycentric coords

24/10/2020
Solved depth mapping issues
Can reliably render cube
Mapped q,e to rotation
Began work on object class
Operator mapped vector and matrix maths

25/10/2020
Fixed operator mapping
Rendering in a glitchy ortho - diagnose
Created matrices for object and projection
finished draw tri routine
enabled line art
removed value assignment code, moved to struct def

28/10/2020
diagnosed failed rendering
Finished object rendering algo
enable movement independent of camera
object cube missing top and bottom
object cube not matching up with other cube -  diagnose
binding camera rotation to mouse
redo rotation of camera
Added matrix to camera

31/10/2020
Halloween
Found possible fix to improper camera movement
camera is better but neeeds more fixes

1/11/2020
Finally fixed rendering sequence
Deprecating old rendering sequence
Deprecating old wireframe renderer
fixed cube model
Added more cubes for testing
Working on clipping algo

8/11/2020
Took a break
Fixed clipping 1,2 points at far plane
Fixed cube not rotating independently
Seperated camera and cube rotation
Fixed renderer to show missing face - the last face of a mesh was being ommited

9/11/2020
Seperated near and far clip functions
Finalised far clip

10/11/2020
Finished clipping algo
Connected to git

12/11/2020
Clipping working mostly - glitchy around edges
included methods to find normals
Implementing shading models	- flat ambient and diffuse
Noticing shapes forming on rendered. Not clipping related.
added normal data to tris

13/11/2020
Fixed clipping issues - moved projection after clip
normalized normals in cross product
Stopped acne due to depth filtering

14/11/2020
Fixed most warning messages regarding casting errors
Added method to draw a buffer. Move regular drawing here
Found issue causing artifacts on screen - depth buffer looped horizontally and clipped itself

15/11/2020
Fixed depth buffer loop error
Seriously considering GPU usage
Implemented backface culling
Implemented text libraries
Implemented load from obj, added a second cube

16/11/2020
Implemented a single color per object

To do for next user:
Fix bad bfc
Fix triangle early quit optimisation  -- kinda gay, will need to rework if gpu is used anyway


Housekeeping:
Fix cube mesh to be clockwise and complete
Make sure barycentrics are recalculated at clipping
Check if half size screens are actually benificial

Notes:


Render procedure:
Setup
For each object, 
	render object
Clean up

Render obj:
	check validity
	Find conversion matrix
	for each tri
		convert to ccv
		clip tri
		find normal
		find color
		project
		draw


Op functions
Clear depth buffer
Quick normalize

Op work
Clip by object
replace with const references
do zipping realtime?
find cause of slowdown with large tris
reformat and folderize
std::map or std::unordered map
use gpu
move all vendor functions into a discrete wrapper
move wrapper and vendors into folder
remove return of temporary values
Load objects and textures only when needed, then cache
use uint 32
write deg conversion and ensure it is used everywhere
add option to bake a model into the world space
Catch errors from functions
fix casting errors
Seperate models and objects
investigate Finite difference normal method - fast
